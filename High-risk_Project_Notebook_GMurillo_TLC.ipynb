        "tlc_chat_with_context(\"TLC, my apologies, I haven't been answering your questions. The headache is a dull pain. I do not know what is causing it. However, I am fatigued. I work full-time and I am a part-time student. There have not been many changes in my life recently. However, I am very busy from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to bed. I am getting less sleep than usual. The numbness on the right side of my body just started a few minutes ago. So, what should I do since I have a headache and cannot feel the right side of my body? Should I call my family member and have them take me to the emergency room of the hospital? I am just worried about the cost, since I do not have health insurance and I do not have a lot of savings. Thank you, TLC, for being there for me. I appreciate your kindness and support.\")"
